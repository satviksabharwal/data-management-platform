During my Master's degree, I collaborated with a team of five individuals to create a dummy startup called "dmSuite" as part of our Planspiel Web Engineering subject. Over a six-month period, we developed our team website and the product website for dmSuite. Additionally, we designed and implemented a comprehensive data management platform with a range of features such as user authentication, user profiles, file statistics visualization, file operations (CRUD), file tagging, file access control, file search, and file sharing with email notifications.

Throughout the project, we actively engaged with stakeholders through presentations and pitches to ensure their involvement and feedback. This allowed us to effectively communicate our progress and align our approach with stakeholder expectations. Working as a team enabled us to leverage our individual strengths and fostered a dynamic environment that promoted innovation and problem-solving.

This experience not only enhanced my technical skills in web engineering but also provided valuable insights into project management, including stakeholder engagement and delivering presentations. The creation of dmSuite and its data management platform showcased my ability to contribute to a team project, deliver high-quality work, and effectively communicate and collaborate with stakeholders. I believe this experience has significantly enriched my professional growth and prepared me for future endeavors in web engineering and project management.

Currently, our team website can be accessed at "https://dmsuite.de/", while our product website is temporarily unavailable due to the challenges of maintaining the cost of the database infrastructure on AWS. However, the source code for our product is available in the repository.

In order to run this web application on your local machine, you will need certain environment variables to be set up. There are two .env files to be added: one inside the root directory and one in the /server directory.

Then, after you have set up the environment variables, you need to:
- Install the dependencies. Run `yarn install` inside the root directory and /server directory.
- Finally, use the command `yarn start` inside the root directory to run the app!
