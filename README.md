In order to run this web application on your local machine, you will need certain environment variables to be set up. There are two .env files to be added: one inside the root directory and one in the /server directory. Please contact calvin.liusnando@s2021.tu-chemnitz.de to receive the .env files.

Then, after you have set up the environment variables, you need to:
- Install the dependencies. Run `yarn install` inside the root directory and /server directory.
- Finally, use the command `yarn start` inside the root directory to run the app!
